            <p>"Every year, like clockwork, DJ Bentley is a regular presence at the CWMAs, and for good reason—he’s a goddammed killer on the decks. Few DJs have the ability to flawlessly bounce around through genres as this Salt Lake City-based DJ does. Bentley is a resident DJ at Park City Live and has been a fixture at many of Utah’s biggest parties, like the Greek Knights New Year’s Eve Gala. Expect Bentley to play a healthy mix of rap, pop, trap, house, whatever—he can do it all." - City Weekly</p>

            <p>DJ Bentley has all the skills needed to bridge the gap between any genre. He keeps party-goers on their toes non-stop with his vast and intricate mix of dance, house, pop, hip-hop and more.
